            <p>We take in ill and injured animals and many that are not immediate candidates for adoption. We receive pets that are no longer wanted, pets from people who can no longer care for them, as well as stray animals. We would rather you keep your animal. If you would like assistance, call us before you bring your animal in and we will help you with your decision.</p>

            <p>We work hard to give second chances to every healthy and rehabilitatable animal. With your help, we can do better if you can volunteer to foster a dog or cat, adopt a pet, or volunteer in one of our facilities. More animals keep coming - an average of 36 a day. We would like to save more lives. Community education is a key component of our ongoing effort to save more lives.</p>
