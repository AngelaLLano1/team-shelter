              Our family has created a home for two dogs.
            The adopting process was very easy.
            It has changed our lives.
            Our two children are very happy with our decision.
            Our family feels complete. The children named the dogs Pete and Brad.
            We thank the Adopt Don't Shop Company for allowing us the opportunity to adopt.

            <p> We went to the Adopt Don't Shop shelter because my wife and I decided to get a puppy. We have no children. However, after going through the application and completing a tour, our application was accepted. We were so happy with the company that we decided to refer this company to our friends and family. </p>

            <p> I always loved dogs. I bought a house in Idaho and I decided to purchase a dog, but my friend told me about a shelter called "Adopt Dont Shop". <br>I decided to visit the shelter and I fell in love with a black terrier. I was so surprised of the fact that I didn't have to pay to purchase the exact same dog that I was going to buy. Within one hour the paper work was filed and finished and I was on my way with my new best friend. Thank you Adopt Don't Shop!</p>
