Adopt, Don't Shop is a nonprofit organization that finds homes for abandoned cats and dogs throughout the Tri-State area, and provides behavior intervention when needed to improve chances of adoption.  Founded in 2017, we operate a make-believe animal shelter in Culdesac, Idaho. We also provide programs that enhance the bond between animals and people. We have never been to or seen Culdesac. If you find it, please let us know.

Adopt, Don't Shop is a 501 (c) nonprofit organization (EIN: 11-6101487).
